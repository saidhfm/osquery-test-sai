## Handling Common Manager Questions

### "Will this break anything?"
**Answer**: "No - it's built on our existing osquery system. If it fails, everything else keeps working. Zero risk."

### "How much will this cost?"
**Answer**: "Development is done. Just $500 for AWS testing. The system impact is less than 5%."

### "Do we really need this?"
**Answer**: "One major incident costs $50K+. This prevents incidents and automates investigation. It pays for itself immediately."

### "Is this just technical complexity?"
**Answer**: "Actually, it simplifies our security team's job. Instead of 4-hour manual investigations, they get instant answers."

### "Can we try it safely?"
**Answer**: "Yes - complete testing plan ready. We can test in isolation with zero production risk."

### "What if the team doesn't have time?"
**Answer**: "The hardest part is done. Testing and deployment are automated. Minimal team time required."

## Success Metrics
